# ToDuo
This cross platform mobile application was developped to help users get motivated to be productive and learn new skills, build healthy habbits and create lasting friendships.

To use the app, the user has to:
1)Create an account and log in. 
2)Create a new goal and they chose which category the goal best fits in
3)add milestones to their goal as well as a quick description.
---After this,they will be added matched to another goal by a different user with a similar category. ---
4)Begin working on the goal. Using our tools, such as built in chat feature, a to do list, and a milestone display, the users will get closer to achiving their goal.
5)After completing a milestone, the user must request an approval for the milestone by the user they matched with (AKA accountabuddy)
6)Once all milestones are comlpeted, the goal will be marked as completed, and the User will have achived their Goal!!!
